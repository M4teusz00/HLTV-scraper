# HLTV Scraper

This project scrapes **CS:GO tournament and match data** from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org/) and saves it into an Excel file (`.xlsx`).  
The dataset is designed to be imported into **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards (see the project [HLTV Dashboard](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-dashboard)).

## Features
- Scrapes CS2 tournament data (matches, player stats etc.) from HLTV.org.  
- Exports structured datasets in Excel format (`.xlsx`).  
- Provides a **sample dataset** for testing or demonstration without scraping.  
- Output data is ready for Power BI visualization and analysis.

## Code Description
### Cell 1 â€“ Match Data Scraper
This code scrapes match-level data from HLTV.org for selected event ID's (I selected last 3 big LAN events: Esports World Cup 2025, BLAST Bounty 2025 Season 2 Finals, IEM Cologne 2025). The ID's you can find on hltv.org in Events tab. If you will click the tournament you want to scrap, find Results tab. You will see there the event ID like this:

- Collects **event name**, **team names**, **scores**, **match date**, and **maps played**.
- Handles pagination to get all matches for each event.
- Converts the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame (`matches_df`).
- Styles the DataFrame for readability and highlights the higher team score per match.

## ðŸ“Š Sample Data

A sample dataset is included in this repository to illustrate the structure of the scraped data. The actual dataset which is generated by the scraper is available here: [HLTV Dashboard](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-dashboard) in file named Tournament_Data_Tables.xlsx.

**File:** `Tournament_Sample_Data_Tables.xlsx`  
**Sheet:** `matches_data`

**Columns:**
- **Team 1** â€“ name of the first team  
- **Team 1 Score** â€“ score of the first team  
- **Team 2** â€“ name of the second team  
- **Team 2 Score** â€“ score of the second team  
- **Event** â€“ tournament or event name  
- **Date (raw)** â€“ date of the match (readable format)  
- **Date (unix)** â€“ date in UNIX timestamp  
- **Maps** â€“ maps played in the match  
- **Match** â€“ descriptive match name (Team1 vs Team2)  
- **Match_ID** â€“ unique identifier for the match  

## **Matches_data:**
